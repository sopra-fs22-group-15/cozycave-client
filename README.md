# CozyCave.ch Client
## Introduction

Cozy Cave is designed to provide a platform for people looking for a place to live, to connect with landlords and shared accommodations that are looking for prospective tenants. Those looking for tenants will be able to create new listings, and students can apply to these listings with the details they have in their profile - this only takes a single click. In turn, the landlords can see at a glance who applied to one of their listing, view their profile, and can accept or deny them - in both cases, the student is notified about the decision. 

Especially intuitive is the way that students get automatically identified through their email address by the system, which then ensures that only students can apply to properties. Furthermore, the real-time collaborative feature allows students to connect with each other and exchange contact details, for example to look for accomodation together, or just as a way to find like-minded people to form a new flatshare with.

With the unique filtering, students can find the properties theyâ€™re interested in. - e.g. if someone wants to live in a house with only other people of the same gender, Cozy Cave got the student covered through its filtering mechanism.

Last but not least, external APIs are used to display the location of listings on a map for the user, and also calculate travel times from the user's important addresses (e.g. work address) to the listing's location, which is very convenient to avoid repetitive Google Maps searches when browsing through listings.

## High-level components

## Launch&Deployment
`npm` is required for working with the application. If not installed, follow these [instructions](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/install-node-js-npm-on-windows). <br><br>
Use `npm run start` to run the application locally. In the project directory, make sure that `const devUrl` in `src/helpers/getDomain.js` is set to `http://localhost:8080/v1`. <br><br>
If you wish to test the local front-end version with the real server, you can set it to `https://sopra-fs22-group-15-server.herokuapp.com/v1`.<br><br>
**Note: The front-end depends on having a running server and database - refer to the server repository instructions for running these.**

## Roadmap
### EXTENDED TRAVEL DIRECTIONS

Currently, only travel times are calculated - how long a person would need to arrive at the listing's location. However, the actual API used (transport.opendata.ch) calculates the entire travel path, including trains/buses and stops. These could be incorporated into an extended view of the listing.

### IMPLEMENTATION OF A BUSINESS MODELL

For our customers (e.g Universities), which could need to make a revenue through Cozy Cave to offset maintenance costs, we need to design and implement a business model. For instance, the easiest and most simple way would be to display commercials next to the AD of our listings. A more advanced and unethical way is to sell the profile data and search preferences of our customers to third parties (e.g. what a customer would be willing to pay for a flat, where the student is looking for accomodation etc.).
